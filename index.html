                Rishi Kapoor has been admitted to a Mumbai hospital for viral fever. 
                He was recently discharged from a hospital in Delhi after suffering from infection because of pollution.

                At first, when Rishi Kapoor informed that he will be moving to New York,
                 the actor denied having cancer. It was months later that his family confirmed that the actor was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer. Since then, it has been over ten months that Rishi, accompanied by his wife Neetu Kapoor, is staying in NYC. At present, he is on a road to recovery and it is being reported that Rishi and Neetu may return to India early September.
                All this while, their actor-son Ranbir Kapoor and daughter Riddhima Kapoor Sahni have been there with them as a pillar of strength. However, initially, it took some time for Ranbir to grasp the news of Rishi's cancer.
